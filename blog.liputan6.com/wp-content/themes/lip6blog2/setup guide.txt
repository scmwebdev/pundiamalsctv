The Theme displays thumbnail images assigned to posts on the minipost block on the index page and on the featured post slider.
These images are assigned to post using wordpress customfield feature. The images are sized and cropped to the desired dimension automatically. 

To do this, while you make a post, go to the customfield section and 
	
	* enter the image url in the value field 

	* and use "preview" in the Name field.


For the images to work they have to be uploaded to your own server where wordpress is installed. Remote linked images will not work.
There is a folder named "cache" within the theme folder. Make sure it is CHMOD to 777 for the images to work properly.
